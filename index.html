      <h2>Our Mission: To line our pockets by continuing the eternal spin of the 
        Military-Industrial complex wheel, through copious lobbying
        and warmongering in the press. The exploitation of third world workers
        is just a perk of the job for us bloodsucking leeches!

          to report your activities to the government, as well as any interested and paying 
          dystopic corporation. And as a special bonus, it can transform into a deadly, remote
